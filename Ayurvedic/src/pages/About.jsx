              <p>
                We chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives, and
                sometimes that means starting over with Plan B, Plan C, or even
                Plan Z. This film brings together the inner thoughts and
                ambitions of the people at Sanofi, who find inspiration from
                loved ones, motivation from families, and a united strength to
                push harder until we turn a corner.

                our peers, multi-faceted and embedded at all levels of our
                organization. We aim to have a transformative and sustainable
                impact on the health and well-being of people, vulnerable
